# QuoteFul 📜✨

QuoteFul is a straightforward quotes app📱, designed to showcase the implementation of modern Android architecture components within an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. 
It leverages the [Quotable API](https://docs.quotable.io) to provide users with a curated collection of insightful quotes in a clean and intuitive interface.

## Built With 🛠

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/): Kotlin is the first-class and official programming language for Android development, offering concise syntax and powerful features.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html): Coroutines are used for asynchronous programming, making it easier to perform tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture):
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata): LiveData is a lifecycle-aware observable data holder class that ensures data updates are delivered only to active components.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): ViewModel stores UI-related data that survives configuration changes and is not destroyed on UI changes.
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room): Room is used for local data storage and provides an abstraction layer over SQLite database.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android): Material Components offers modular and customizable UI components following Material Design guidelines.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/): Koin is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- [Ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/): Ktlint is a Kotlin linter for code formatting to ensure consistent code style.
- [MockK](https://mockk.io/): MockK is a mocking library for Kotlin, used for testing purposes.

## Architecture 🏛️

QuoteFul follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the UI, presentation logic, and data handling concerns. This architecture enhances code readability, testability, and maintainability of the app.
